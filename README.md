Find a bar, drink awesome beer!

---

**beersomme** is a bar recommender app based on beer preference. 
I created this project at [Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com) in three weeks.
I scraped beer descriptions from [Ratebeer](http://www.ratebeer.com) and extracted keywords relevant to the flavor of each beer.  Using these features, I found which beers were most similar to each other. 
To find nearby beers, I used local beer check-in information from [Untappd](http://untappd.com) to act as a proxy for beer lists.
By combining these data sources, I provide recommendations to the user on where to get their next beer.
