Inspired by our customers, employees and brewers, the Sculpin IPA is bright with aromas of apricot, peach, mango and lemon. Its lighter body also brings out the crispness of the hops. This delicious Ballast Point Ale took a Bronze Medal at the 2007 Great American Beer Festival in the Pro Am category. The Sculpin fish has poisonous spikes on its fins that can give a strong sting.

The combination of hops in this beer creates a distinctive but not overpowering hop character. The beer is dry hopped with Ahtanum, Simcoe\\xae*, and East Kent Goldings hops for a powerful citrus and earthy aroma. The hop character is balanced by a slight sweetness and full body from the malt blend.',\n",

We believe that this style best celebrates the refreshingly light flavor of malted wheat. You may notice that the head on this beer is unusually abundant, with a consistency similar to whipped egg whites. This is due to protein contributed by the wheat.\\nThe brewers at Anchor are proud to have revived not only rich hearty dark beers, but also this light crisp style of a modern American wheat beer.\\nWheat malt contributes to an unusual lightness and dryness to the palate, and this\\u2014combined with the distinctive flavor of the wheat\\u2014makes for a perfect thirst-quenching beverage.

        "   u'description': u'Choc beer was named after its place of origin, the Choctaw Nation. The Choctaw people brewed a homemade beer and taught the Italian immigrants, who came to work in the coal mines, how to make the home brew. Pete Pritchard was one of those immigrants. He came to the US with his family in 1903 and began to work in the coal mines at age eleven. At twenty-one years of age, he was nearly killed in a mine accident. After the accident, Pete Pritchard began making and selling choc beer, along with sausages and cheese in his home in Krebs. A prosperious business developed and in 1925, Peter formally opened a restaurant in his home. Pete\\'s Place Restaurant served choc beer until 1932 when Pete was arrested for the brew. In 1964, Bill Prichard, the sone of the original owner, developed a \"gentleman\\'s agreement\" with the powers that be about the illegal choc beer...until a statewide newspaper ran a front page, headline story about the agreement. That was the end of choc beer at Pete\\'s until Joe Prichard, Bill\\'s son who now wears the chef\\'s hat and has the choc beer recipe, reintroduced choc beer as a legal brew in 1995.\\nChoc brand beer is brewed in small batches in our brewery using the finest ingredients. Starting with beer-perfect Krebs water, we blend American Malted Barley, wheat, and roasted malts with American-grown Liberty and Cascade hops to create more than just a beer... a legendary Choc beer is unfiltered, so all the flavor we create stays where it belongs. And since it\\'s unfiltered, you may notice a cloudy haze in the beer. This is normal. Tradition dictates Choc beer be \"bottle-conditions,\" which means it\\'s fermented a second time in the bottle, as well as aged in the bottle, resulting in a thin layer of yeast at the bottom. You can choose to carefully decant the beer off the yeast, or simply drink it, as we do, and let the yeast travel into your glass. Either way, we hope you enjoy our beer, a handcrafted Krebs original.

The use of lactic fermentation and ingredients like coriander and orange peel are hallmarks of the style, as are the cloudiness and the pale color that give the beer its name. On the other hand, it\\u2019s a modern, uniquely American specialty brew; big, flavorful, and spiced with cardamom, lavender, and grains of paradise. Two Jokers has a refreshing tartness, nicely balanced by a well rounded malt bill graced by notes of caramel. Belgian yeast brings floral aromas with hints of banana and clove, and a citrusy zing to the tongue. Two Jokers Double-Wit pairs well with the lighter fare of spring and summer, such as grilled fish or chicken, feta cheese, fresh garden salads, and fruit compotes.',\n",

With a slightly cloudy appearance and traditional yeast, it is a balanced, agreeable offering.

This unique Belgian-style wheat beer was brewed with zested Curacao orange peel and just enough spices to keep your taste buds guessing. Our brewers tinkered with the recipe for months at the Public House in Bend, Oregon, before perfecting what will arrive on shelves in 22-ounce bottles this June. One prototype of the Wit was sampled at Portland's Spring Beer and Wine Festival in March, where it earned a gold medal.\",\n",

        "   u'description': u'Danish: I starten af 1900-tallet udvandrede Drag\\xf8r-drengen Didrik Crappe til Trankebar for at etablere koloniens f\\xf8rste sildemelsfabrik. Gennem hele sin opv\\xe6kst i Drag\\xf8r var Didrik tre gange ugentligt blevet fodret med sin mors Boller i Karry, der var krydret s\\xe5 gevaldigt, at den stakkels dreng ganske fik \\xf8delagt sin ford\\xf8jelse. Nogle historikere mener, at sildemelet blot var et p\\xe5skud for at Didrik kunne flygte fra sin mors bollegryder. If\\xf8lge myten stod Didrik naglet til forstavnen, p\\xe5 den damper, der tog ham bort fra sit ellers elskede Drag\\xf8r, og her \\u2013 med en k\\xe6k \\xd8resundsbrise i sit h\\xe5r \\u2013 skulle han have r\\xe5bt ordene: \\u201dAldrig mere skal en karrybolle passere dette sv\\xe6lg\\u201d.\\nHjulpet af det gode lokale Trankebarske Lager\\xf8l fik den unge mand atter styr p\\xe5 sin ford\\xf8jelse. Faktisk endte han med selv at etablere et bryggeri, hvis \\xf8l var s\\xe5 smagfuldt, at rygtet om det n\\xe5ede helt tilbage til Danmark. M\\xe5ske var sildemelet den unikke, hemmelige ingrediens, som alle talte om. Nuvel, snart sejlede dampere i rutefart fra Trankebar til Drag\\xf8r udelukkende ladet med Didriks gode \\xf8l. S\\xe5ledes var India Pale Lager f\\xf8dt.\\nEnglish: Didrik Crappe was a Copenhagen lad who set sail to Tranquebar in the early 19th Century to establish a herring meal factory in this exotic Danish colony. He suffered terribly from indigestion because of his mother\\u2019s home cooking, esp. her extremely spicy chicken curries that he was forced to eat several times a week. Some historians maintain that the whole business of founding a herring meal factory was just an excuse to get away from his mother\\u2019s pots and pans. There is a legend saying that Didrik posted himself in the bow of the clipper carrying him away from his beloved hometown, and exclaimed \"No more rice and curry for this fair Dane!\" But the story has a happy end. Thanks to the fine lager brewed locally in Tranquebar, Didrik\\u2019s indigestion was cured, and in fact he soon established his own brewery out there, creating a beer so tasty that rumors of it flew all the way back to Denmark. Perhaps the herring meal was the secret ingredient that distinguished Didrik\\u2019s brew from all others. Anyhow, soon clippers carrying nothing but barrels of his product were leaving Tranquebar for Copenhagen every day of the week. Thus the Indian Pale Lager was born.\\nA crisp and dry Pale Lager with a base of only pilsener malts. Hopped \\u2013 and dry-hopped \\u2013 with Amarillo, Cascade and Citra. No rice or curry was added.',\n",
